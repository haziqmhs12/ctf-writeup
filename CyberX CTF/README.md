>Can you help me reveal the IP Address of joboncampus.com?
>Flag format: CyberX{ip_address_here}

Given that domain is joboncampus.com. So we can find the ip address from [who.is](https://who.is)

CyberX{109.123.238.148}
```

## Robots
>Someone told me that this CTFd platform has a special file that tells web crawlers where they can and cannot go. Can you find where these instructions are stored?

As like the name of the challenge and hint which said file that tells web crawlers mean we need to go to [robots.txt](http://34.142.170.50/robots.txt) of CTFd platform
```
CyberX{r0b0ts_3ndp01nt!}
